angular-multipage-boilerplate-with-node
=======================================

exactly the same as my other repository but with a node server

-- bolerplate for multi page webapp with router in angular, this gives deep links to each page

-- loads html partials with get requests

-- in one of the html pages that gets loaded there is a button - angular detects this button and logs a message to the console

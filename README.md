angular-multipage-boilerplate-with-node
=======================================

exactly the same as my other repository but with a node server so make sure you have node installed from nodejs.org then download this repository and use terminal to 'cd' into the directory.  Then type 'node app.js' to start up the server and go to http://localhost:3000 with your browser

-- bolerplate for multi page webapp with router in angular, this gives deep links to each page

-- loads html partials with get requests

-- in one of the html pages that gets loaded there is a button - angular detects this button and logs a message to the console
